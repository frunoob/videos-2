∮ More than words can say ∮

∮ 如果我不在乎 ∮
∮ If I didn't care ∮

∮ Would I feel this way? ∮

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.620
∮ 如果这不是爱 ∮
∮ If this isn't love ∮

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.250
∮ 为何我会颤抖 ∮
∮ Then why do I thrill? ∮

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.460
∮ 又是什么盘旋在我脑海 ∮
∮ And what makes my head go round and round ∮

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.340
∮ 而我初心仍在驻守 ∮
∮ While my heart stands still? ∮

∮ 如果我不在乎 ∮
∮ If I didn't cares ∮

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.930

∮ 我的每次祈祷 ∮
∮ Would my every prayer begin and end ∮

∮ With just your name? ∮

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.620
∮ 且我依然深信 ∮
∮ And would I be sure ∮

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.540
∮ 这份爱无与伦比 ∮
∮ That this is love beyond compare? ∮

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.250
∮ 如果我不在乎 ∮

吉时香烟（Chesterfield）
赫伍口中的“Yes, Richmond, Virginia.”
说的就是吉时香烟
在世界上有很高知名度，很高人气，历史也悠久
最初由德拉蒙德（DRUMMOND）烟草公司
创立于1873年，迄今已近150年

00:59:46.330 --> 01:00:05.540
体制
可理解为包括某种规则、习惯、意识的环境
甚至是周围人的眼光、期许和评价
体制化
是指对这种环境的适应
达到“内化”的程度
从而形成一道熟视无睹的围墙
将自我禁锢其中
因此，体制化
可归纳为“过度顺应”

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.730

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:34.190
罗伯特·弗罗斯特，美国诗人
素有“新英格兰诗人”之称，其诗朴素无华，舒畅自然
《桦树》节选——
“我真想离开人世一会儿
回来后再重新开始。
愿命运不再故意误解我
然后部分地成全我的希望，把我迅速
拿开而不送回。人世是个适合爱的地方：
我不知道还要去哪里会更好。
我会爬着一棵桦树而去，
从黑色的树枝攀爬到那向着天空的雪白
树干，直到那树已不再能够承受我，
并弯下自己的树梢再次把我送回来。
不管是离去还是返回我都会愉快。”

杜弗伦先生  请描述
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.270
命案当晚你和妻子争吵的情形
the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.610
我们吵得很凶
It was very bitter.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.280
她说不怕我知道  她讨厌偷偷摸摸
She said she was glad I knew,that she hated all the sneaking around.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.310
她还说  想去雷诺市办离婚
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.220
-你怎样回答?  -我拒绝离婚
-What was your response?  -I told her I would not grant one.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.590
“你休想活着去雷诺市。”
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.130
邻居作证你说过这句话
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.830
也许吧
If they say so.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.860
我气炸了  记不清楚
I really don't remember. I was upset.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.570
你们吵完以后呢？
What happened after you argued with your wife?

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.510
她收拾行李
She packed a bag.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.840
去跟昆汀住……
She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.580
格伦·昆汀  乡村俱乐部的高尔夫球教练
Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.920
你最近才发现  他是你太太的情夫
whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.590
你跟踪她吗？
Did you follow her?

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.360
我先去酒吧买醉
I went to a few bars first.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.430
然后去他家  但没人在
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.060
我停了车
I parked in the turnout...

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.290
等他们
and waited.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.100
用意何在？
With what intention?

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.140
我不确定
I'm not sure.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.770
我醉了
I was confused...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.060
糊里糊涂
drunk.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.120
我想……
I think...

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.170
最多只是吓吓他们
mostly I wanted to scare them.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.750
结果他们一回来  你就冲进屋杀了他们
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.110
不  我逐渐酒醒
I was sobering up.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.420
开车回家睡觉
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.100
路中把枪丢入皇家河
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.290
我已讲得很清楚
I've been very clear on this point.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.600
但清洁妇隔天早晨上工时
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.400
发现床上的二人尸体
and finds your wife in bed with her lover...

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.700
身上满是点三八的弹孔
riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.280
你不觉得这很巧吗？  还是只有我这么想？
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.170
是很巧
Yes, it does.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.550
但你仍声称早在案发之前
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.870
就已丢弃了枪
before the murders took place.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.250
这种说法倒是很省事
That's very convenient.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.120
这是实话
It's the truth.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.060
警方打捞三天都没找到
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.640
这样就无法比对你的手枪和
so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets...

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.060
从受害人血尸内取出的弹头
taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.080
所以呢
And that also...

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.980
这样也非常省事  不是吗  杜弗伦先生
is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.380
我是清白的
Since I am innocent of this crime...

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.220
所以找不到枪  反倒对我非常不利
I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.470
一切证据都向各位指明了案情
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.510
脚印和胎痕证明被告在场
We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.580
散落地面的子弹上有他的指纹
Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.750
酒瓶碎片上同样也有指痕
A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.510
最重要的是
And most of all...

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.780
一位美女与情夫
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.020
相拥而死
lying dead in each other's arms.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.820
他们是有伤风化
They had sinned.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.560
但是
But was their crime so great...

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.030
罪该致死吗？
as to merit a death sentence?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.540
与此同时  请各位
While you think about that...

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.770
再考虑一件事
think about this:

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.030
一只左轮手枪只能装六发子弹  而非八发
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.280
所以他并非一时冲动
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.280
冲动即使不可宽恕  但尚可理解
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.510
然而
No.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.880
这是复仇
This was revenge...

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.500
残忍而冷血的谋杀  想想看
of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.100
这两人各中四枪
Four bullets per victim.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.560
共八枪  而非六枪
Not six shots fired, but eight.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.660
因此他是先射完一轮
That means that he fired the gun empty...

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.040
再装弹补上两枪
and then stopped to reload so that he could shoot each of them again.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.740
一人添一枪
An extra bullet per lover...

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.840
射入脑袋
right in the head.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.150
你面目冷漠  全无悔意  杜弗伦先生
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.690
看见你就令我齿冷
It chills my blood just to look at you.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.360
根据缅因州赋予我的权力
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.860
我判处你两次终身监禁
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.760
分别为两位死者偿命  退庭！
one for each of your victims. So be it!

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.060
坐下
Sit.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.440
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满20年
We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.570

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.850
当你进了囚笼……
And when they put you in that cell...

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.390
门闸锁上……
and those bars slam home...

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.050

无此打算
I hadn't planned on it.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.460
能给我吗？
Do you mind?

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.700
又肥又嫩
That's nice and ripe.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.250
杰克说  谢谢你
Jake says thank you.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.920
它从巢中掉到地上
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.730
我要养到它会飞
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.860
讨厌  他来了
Oh, no! Here he comes.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.440
早安  伙计们
Morning, fellas.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.610
真是个美好早晨啊
Fine morning, isn't it?

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.170
知道为何如此美好吗？
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:18.680
烟拿出来  就地排好
Send them down. I want them lined up...

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.510
像合唱队一样排整齐
just like a pretty little chorus line.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.810
真壮观
Look at that.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.520
-真受不了他  -我的乖乖
-I can't stand this guy.  -Oh, Lord!

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.680
没错  正宗吉时香烟
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.220
闻我的屁吧
Smell my ass!

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.420
闻完再闻我的
After he smells mine.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.560
瑞德  可惜你大大看走眼
That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.600
不过我真感谢我的猪公
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.800
出院后我得亲亲他
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:49.210
请他抽烟才对  小人得志
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.040
嘿  泰瑞
Hey, Tyrell.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.370
这周你在医务室值班吗？
You pull infirmary duty this week?

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.910
那肥仔怎样了？
How's my horse doing anyway?

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.440
挂了
Dead.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.480
海利打爆了他的头
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.880
医生回家睡觉了
Doc had gone home for the night.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.660
他一直僵到天亮
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.350
根本无药可救
By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.930
他叫什么名字？
What was his name?

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.570
你说什么？
What'd you say?

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.880
我想知道他的名字
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.310
关你屁事  菜鸟
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.450
死人还关心什么名字
Doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.030
嘿
Hey

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.500
有人上过你了吗？
Anybody come at you yet?

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.480
你名草有主了吗？
Anybody get to you yet?

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.680
牢里人人需要朋友
Hey, we all need friends in here.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.650
我可以当你朋友
I could be a friend to you.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.260
不易上手
Hard to get.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.860
正合我意
I like that.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.040
起初安迪不与人来往
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.350
大概心事重重
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.620
努力适应牢狱生活
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.550
直到一个月后
Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth...

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.120
他主动才找人攀谈
to say more than two words to somebody.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.880
那个人……
As it turned out...

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.230
就是我
that somebody was me.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.770
我叫安迪·杜弗伦
I'm Andy Dufresne.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.740
杀妻的银行家
Wife-killing banker.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.310
为了什么？
Why'd you do it?

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.810
我没犯罪
I didn't, since you ask.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.250
你来对地方了
You're going to fit right in.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.150
这里人人都无罪
Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.980
-赫伍  你为何入狱？  -我无罪  被律师害了
-What you in here for?  -Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.590
听说你颇爱耍酷
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.390
难道你的屁比别人香？
You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.090
你说呢？
What do you think?

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.500
说老实话  我还不清楚
To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.440
我知道你很有办法
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.710
我能够让你有求必应
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.710
我想要一把石锤
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.940
什么？
What?

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.480
石锤
A rock hammer.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.520
-用来干什么？  -何必问呢？
-What is it and why?  -What do you care?

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.590
若是牙刷  我就直接报价
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.230
因为牙刷不危险  对吗？
But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.200
也有道理
Fair enough.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.260
石锤大约六、七寸长
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.800
-像鹤嘴锄  -鹤嘴锄？
-Looks like a miniature pickax.  -Pickax?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.200
敲石头用的
For rocks.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.040
石英？
Quartz?

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.870
石英
Quartz

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.580
云母  页岩……
And some mica, shale...

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:17.950
石灰石
limestone.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.310
所以呢？
So?

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.090
我曾是石痴
So I'm a rock hound.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.620
我想重拾往日嗜好
At least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.020
我看你是想捶人家脑袋
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.060
不是的  这儿没人犯着我
No, I have no enemies here.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.630
没有？  且慢
No? Wait a while.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.800
话已传开了
Word gets around.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.960
三姐妹对你有性趣
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.140
尤其是伯格斯
Especially Bogs.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.580
就算跟他们说我不是同性恋也没用吗
Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.220
他们也不是
Neither are they.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.880
同性恋是人  但他们是畜牲
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:02.800
想干就干  根本不在乎你
Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.520
我若是你  便会加倍提防
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.500
-谢谢你的忠告  -反正不用钱
-Thanks for the advice.  -Well, that's free.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.810
你明白我的顾虑吧
You understand my concern.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.600
我不用石锤惹事  行吗？
If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.570
那你想逃狱  挖地道？
Then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.140
有什么好笑？
What did I miss?  What's so funny?

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.250
你看到它就明白了
You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.320
它市价多少？
What's an item like this usually go for?

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.020
奇石店卖七美元
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.020
我通常加两成
My normal markup's 20 percent.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.560
不过特殊东西嘛
But this is a specialty item.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:42.230
风险越大  价钱越高  一口价  十美元吧
Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.770
就这样
Ten it is.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.530
其实你是白花钱
Waste of money, if you ask me.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.110
为什么？
Why's that?

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.540
狱方喜欢突击检查
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.120
发现石锤一定没收
They find it, you're going to lose it.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.410
到时候别把我供出来
If they catch you, you don't know me.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.850
否则再也别想跟我做生意
Mention my name, we never do business again.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.450
连口香糖都不卖给你  明白了吗
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.850
我懂的
I understand.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.160
谢谢  你叫……
Thank you, Mr...

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.390
瑞德
Red.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:13.920
叫我瑞德
Name's Red.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.330
瑞德
Red

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.500
为何叫瑞德？
Why do they call you that?

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.270
也许因为我是爱尔兰人吧
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.320
怪不得有人认为他臭屁
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.620
他闷声不响
He had a quiet way about him...

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.120
步伐和谈吐简直异类
a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.950
就像……
He strolled...

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.330
在公园散步  无忧无虑
like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:53.200
仿佛身披隐形衣
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:54.800
没错
yes

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.370
我打一开始
I think it'd be fair to say...

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.880
就喜欢他
I liked Andy from the start.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.210
别磨蹭  屁股后还有一大堆事呢
Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.050
快点  快点
Move it! Come on, move it!

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.690
最近怎样？  你老婆待你还好吗？
How you doing? How's the wife treating you?

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.210
继续走
Keep moving.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.510
继续走
Just go.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.280
瑞德
Red.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.230
安迪说的对
Andy was right.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.670
见到货我就明白了
I finally got the joke.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.370
用它挖地道
It would take a man about 600 years...

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.070
得挖六百年
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.250
-要书吗？  -不要
-Book?  -Not today.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.280
-要书吗？  -不要
-Book? -Not

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.720
老布
Brook

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.790
给杜弗伦的货
Delivery for Dufresne.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:34.970
要书吗？
Book?

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.100
要书吗？
Book?

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.080
杜弗伦
Dufresne

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.140
你的书
Here's your book.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.320
谢谢
Thanks.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:02.350
杜弗伦  漂白粉不够了  你去后面拿点
We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.170
这东西会弄瞎你的眼
This will blind you.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.940
宝贝  嘘
Honey, hush.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.460
反抗
That's it. You fight!

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.150
才刺激
Better that way.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.460
我也希望会是另一种结局
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight...

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.660
就是安迪打赢  全身而退
and the Sisters let him be.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.070
我希望如此
I wish I could tell you that...

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.250
然而监狱不是童话世界
but prison is no fairy-tale world.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.350
他从没说过是谁干的
He never said who did it.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.180
但谁都明白
But we all knew.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.510
日子就这样一天天过去
Things went on like that for a while.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.420
监狱生活就像例行公事
Prison life consists of routine...

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.660
除此之外还是例行公事
and then more routine.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.690
安迪常常挂上新伤
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.000
三姐妹不放过他
The Sisters kept at him.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.300
他有时打赢
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.000
有时吃败仗
Sometimes not.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.340
这就是安迪的监狱生活
And that's how it went for Andy.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.680
这就是他的例行公事
That was his routine.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.950
我相信最初那两年是他最糟糕的
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.820
我也相信日子再这样下去
And I also believe that if things had gone on that way...

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.590
这地方早晚会把他毁了
this place would have got the best of him.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.160
但是  在1949年的春天
But then, in the spring of 1949...

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.260
上头决定
the powers that be decided:

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.800
车牌厂的屋顶需要翻修
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.200
我需要12名自愿者劳作一周
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.400
你们都知道
As you know...

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.670
特别的公差享有特别的待遇
special detail carries with it special privileges.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.280
这是户外公差
It was outdoor detail...

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.950
而五月是户外活动的好时间
and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.520
排好队
Stay in line there.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.890
一百多人志愿报名
More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.160
昂格
Wallace E. Unger.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.030
瑞丁
Ellis Redding.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.790
这不是很巧吗？
Wouldn't you know it?

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.540
我的哥们全都中签
Me and some fellows I know were among the names called.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.730
安迪·杜弗伦
Andrew Dufresne.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.080
其实是每人一包烟买的
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.070
我照常抽两成
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.710
德州一个律师打电话来
So this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.480
我问  “什么事？”
I say, "Yeah?"

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.380
他说  “抱歉，令兄过世。”
He says, "Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.490
-我很遗憾  -我才不为那烂人遗憾
-I'm sorry to hear that.  -I'm not. He was an asshole.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.890
他离家多年  早就当他死了
Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.400
这位大律师说
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.830
“令兄是位富翁。”  挖油井赚了一百万
"He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:27.270
一百万？
A million bucks?

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.070
-对  算他走狗运  -有你一份吗?
-Incredible how lucky some assholes get.  -You going to see any of that?

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.440
他留给我三万五
Thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.410
-美金？  -对
Dollars?

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.580
简直像中乐透嘛
That's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.010
不是吗？
Isn't it?

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.190
政府是白混的吗？
Dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:47.760
它想大口分掉这大饼
Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:49.860
可怜虫
Poor Byron.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.930
过路财神  真够倒霉
Terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.400
有人就是命衰
Some people really got it awful.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.040
你疯了？
Andy, are you nuts?

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.140
专心干活
IKeep your eyes on your mop, man!

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.310
缴了税还剩不少
You'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.310
没错  够换新车
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.680
但买车要缴税
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.650
还要修理  保养  孩子吵着要兜风
maintenance, kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.550
万一报错税  全得自付
Then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.880
告诉你  这就是山姆大叔
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:23.120
石头都榨得出血来
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.400
安迪！
Andy! Andy!

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.930
-他在找死  -继续干活
-Getting himself killed. -I Keep tarring.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.690
什么哥哥  狗屁！
Some brother. Shit!

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.040
海利先生
Mr. Hadley...

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.280
你信任老婆吗？
do you trust your wife?

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.410
真好笑
Oh, that's funny.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.510
你没了牙给我吹喇叭更好笑
You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.090
她会扯你后腿吗？
What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.590
够了  他活得不耐烦了
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:54.850
他要推落安迪！
He'll push him off!

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.930
她要是靠得住
If you trust her, you can keep...

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.560
你就能领三万五
that 35,000.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.460
-你说什么？  -三万五
-What did you say?  -Thirty-five thousand.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.660
全部领到
All of it.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.930
-一个子儿也不少  -你最好别耍我
-Every penny.  -You better start making sense.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.470
想领全额  就赠与太太
If you want to keep it,  give it to your wife.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.580
国税局允许一生一次  最多六万的赠与免税
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.150
-乖乖  免税？  -对
-Bullshit. Tax-free?  -Tax-free.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:18.320
国税局征不到一文钱
IRS can't touch one cent.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.210
你是那个杀妻的银行家？
You're that smart banker that killed his wife.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.790
信你难道不会害我坐牢？
Why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.830
完全合法  你去问国税局也一样
It's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:32.090
我不该开口的  我以为你会去问
I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.960
我不用你教我这些鸟事
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.570
没错  但你要找人填表
Of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:41.330
请律师可得花钱
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.810
没卵的讼棍
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.740
我帮你办  给你省钱
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.010
你领表我来填
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.980
完全免费
nearly free of charge.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.520
只要请我同事一人三瓶啤酒
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.020
“同事”？  够新鲜的
"Coworkers." That's rich!

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.390
做黑手的有酒喝
A man working outdoors feels more like a man...

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.050
才有尊严  这是我的浅见
if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion...

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.490
长官
sir.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.370
看什么看
What are you jimmies staring at?

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.170
干活
Let's go! Work!

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.620
于是呢
And that's how it came to pass...

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.480
在完工前一天
that on the second-to-last day of the job...

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:34.250
49年春的公差犯人
the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49...

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.590
早上十点坐成排
wound up sitting in a row at 10:00 in the morning...

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:43.260
喝着冰镇啤酒
drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw...

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.740
肖申克监狱历来最狠的狱官请的客
that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.380
娘儿们  趁凉快喝
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.040
这王八蛋还装大方呢
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:00.640
阳光洒肩头  仿佛自由人
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.460
像在修缮自家屋顶
We could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.490
像是造物主般自在
We were the lords of all creation.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.650
安迪呢……
As for Andy...

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.530
他窝在凉荫下
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.220
脸上挂着奇异微笑
a strange little smile on his face...

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.660
看着我们喝他的酒
watching us drink his beer.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.140
来一瓶吧？
Want a cold one?

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.750
谢谢  我戒酒了
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.780
你可以说  他想拍狱方马屁
You could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:42.290
或是想博取狱友交情
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.090
但我呢？
Me?

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.100
我认为他只想重温自由
I think he did it just to feel normal again...

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.770
哪怕只有一刹那
if only for a short while.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:53.500
将军
IKing me.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.000
-下棋  是帝王游戏  -什么？
-Chess. Now there's a game of kings. -What?

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.940
讲文明  重谋略
Civilized. Strategic.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.610
神秘得要死  真讨厌
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.650
改天我教你吧
Let me teach you someday.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.180
好
Sure.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.390
我想买个棋盘
We could get a board together.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.680
你找对人了  我不论什么都弄得到
You're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.890
棋盘用买的  但棋子我来刻
We might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.400
一半用雪花石膏  一半用皂石
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.400
要刻上许多年
I think it'll take years.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.130
时间有的是  就是缺石头
Years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.310
操场很贫瘠
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.340
多半是石子
Pebbles, mostly.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.480
咱们算是朋友吧？
We're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.910
算是吧
Yeah, I guess.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.080
能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.990
你为什么杀人？
Why'd you do it?

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.790
我是清白的  瑞德
I'm innocent, Red.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.020
跟大家一样
Just like everybody else here.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.930
你呢？
What are you in for?

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.800
跟你一样  杀人
Murder. Same as you.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.170
清白的？
Innocent?

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.280
我是肖申克唯一有罪的
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.110
歌女呢？
Where's the canary?

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:09.610
你怎么知道？
How did you know?

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.110
-我知道什么？  -原来你不知道
-How did I know what?  -So you don't know.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:13.470
来
Come.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.080
歌女在这里
This is where the canary is.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:24.090
没想到她来寒舍献唱吧
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.990
的确……
That's quite a...

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.590
没想到
surprise.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.130
瑞德
Red

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.300
等一下
Wait, wait.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.330
她要上场了
Here she comes.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.470
我最迷她甩头发的骚样
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.410
这个月看过三场了
I know. I've seen it three times this month.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.510
姬旦  你衣着整齐吗？
Gilda, are you decent?

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.640
在说我？
Me?

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.120
我爱死这段了
God, I love it.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:02.290
听说阁下有求必应
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.030
在下确非浪得虚名  你要什么？
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.360
-丽塔·海华丝  -什么？
-Rita Hayworth. -What?

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.300
弄得到吗？
Can you get her?

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:16.070
这位就是约翰尼·法雷尔啊  久仰久仰
So this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.610
-要几个星期  -几星期？
-Take a few weeks. -Weeks?

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:24.220
我又没把她压在下面  抱歉这么说
I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.030
沉住气哦  法雷尔先生

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:26.310
反正弄得到
But I'll get her.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.650
放心
Relax.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.820
谢了
Thanks.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.150
的确  你该见见他

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.090
说了我来做什么吗？

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.920
不  我要让他惊喜

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.180
-出去  -我得放映
-Get out!  -I got to change reels!

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:55.410
我叫你滚
I said fuck off!

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.920
你不尖叫吗？
Ain't you going to scream?

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.120
咱们算算总帐
Let's get this over with.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.220
他打破我鼻子
He broke my fucking nose!

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:23.770
现在
Now...

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.410
我要解拉链
I'm going to open my fly...

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.440
叫你含什么你就含
and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.180
先舔我  再舔公鸡  因为你害他流鼻血
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.  You broke his nose.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:35.510
他应该得到偿还
He ought to have something to show for it.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.590
它进我的嘴  就跟你分家
You put it in my mouth, you lose it.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.390
不  你没搞懂
No, you don't understand.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.750
我会用钻子刺穿你耳朵
Do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.420
那你知道吗  脑部遇袭
All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury...

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.570
会使人死劲咬
causes the victim to bite down hard.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:53.260
用力之大
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.570
得用撬棍
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.110
才扳得开
with a crowbar.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.610
你怎么知道？
Where do you get this shit?

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.220
书上写的
I read it.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.450
你识字吗  豆腐脑？
You know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.050
亲爱的
Honey!

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:14.720
你不该损我

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.300
伯格斯没逼他吹喇叭
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.630
其他两个也不敢
And neither did his friends.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.900
他们把安迪打个半死
What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.070
在医务室里待了一个月

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.400
伯格斯被关禁闭一周
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

-他想去哪儿？  -抓住脚
-Where's he going?  -Grab his ankles.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:31.640
不要……救命！
No...help!

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:37.900

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.310

The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.640

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:49.310
他被转送到低戒护的医院
They transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.290

To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days...

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:54.320
全靠吸管进食
drinking his food through a straw.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:59.430
我想热烈欢迎安迪出院
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:02.730
没问题
Sounds good to us.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.490
咱们欠他的酒
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.500
他喜欢下棋
The man likes to play chess.

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:10.910
帮他找石头吧
Let's get him some rocks.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.770

What are you, a fucking geologist?

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:58.320
他说的没错
He's right. It ain't.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.430
-那这是什么？  -马粪蛋
-What the hell is it then? -It's a horse apple.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.800
-胡说!  -没有  就是马粪
-Bullshit!  -No, horseshit.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.330
很好
How nice.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.510
人应该有专长
Man should have a skill.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.240
这是什么？
Explain this.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:16.310

很标准
It's pretty clean.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.330

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.670
这个嘛  我不大赞成
I can't say I approve of this.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.810
不过嘛……
But I suppose...

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:47.840
破个例也无妨

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.030
差点忘了

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:10.570
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.680
搜查只是借口
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.380
事实是……
Truth is...

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:26.080
诺顿要秤他斤两

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.070

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:49.100
喜欢洗衣房的工作吗？
You enjoy working the laundry?

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:52.450
不怎么喜欢
No, sir. Not especially.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:55.220
也许我们可以换个别的……
Perhaps we can find something more...

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.920
让你发挥才学
befitting a man of your education.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.490
杰克  老布人呢？
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:12.100
安迪  我听见你来了
I thought I heard you out here.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.330
我转派给你
I've been reassigned to you.

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.940
我听说了
I know, they told me.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.840
真想不到
Ain't that a kick in the head?

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:22.340
来个小小巡礼吧
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:23.710

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.850
都在你眼前了

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.900
记下借书人名字
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:52.140
如此往复  简简单单
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:55.780
-有问题吗？  -你管图书馆多久了?
-Any questions?  -How long have you been librarian?

00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:01.010
1905年入狱  1912年入馆
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.480
这么多年都没有助手？
And have you ever had an assistant?

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.160
没有  根本用不着
No. Not much to it, really.

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:09.160
那为何派我来？
Why me? Why now?

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.890
不知道
I don't know.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.120
但有人作伴真好
But it'd be nice to have some company down here.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.030
杜弗伦
Dufresne

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.680
就是他
That's him. That's the one.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.480
我是狄金斯
I'm Dekins.

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:38.520
我在想……
I was thinking...

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:43.060
为孩子弄个教育基金
about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:48.460
我懂了
I see.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.510
咱们坐下谈吧
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:02.670
老布  有纸笔吗？
Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:15.320
谢谢
Thanks.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.050
那么
So...

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:20.560
狄金斯先生
Mister Dekins...

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.490
然后安迪说
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.700
“你想让贵公子进哈佛还是耶鲁？”
do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:27.960
你少瞎扯
He didn't say that!

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:30.800
真的  老天为证
As God as my witness!

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.810
他愣了一下
Dekins blinked for a second...

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.310
傻笑出来  后来真跟安迪握手了
then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.850
-握你的鸟  -真的握手
-My ass!  -Shook his hand.

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.990
我乐的差点尿出来
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:46.450
若给安迪弄一套西装领带
All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.250
他就成了“咨询先生”
he'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.090
开始交新朋友了  安迪？
Making a few friends?

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.060
也不算“朋友”
I wouldn't say "friends."

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:58.100
我是精通理财的囚徒
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.640
这种本事很受用
It's a wonderful pet to have.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.640
起码不用干洗衣工
Got you out of the laundry, though.

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.080
还派得上更大用场
It might do more than that.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:08.010
比如扩建图书馆  买新书
How about expanding the library. Get some new books.

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:10.810
还不如申请张台球桌
If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.370
对
yes.

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:15.520
你想怎么弄？
How do you expect to do that? I mean...

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.690
我是说  “咨询先生”  你打算怎么弄到新书？
get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.220
找典狱长要钱
I'll ask the warden for funds.

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:26.360
孩子  我经历了六任典狱长
Son, son, son... Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.900
学到的互古不变的真理就是
one immutable, universal truth:

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.530
给钱是不可能的
Not one born whose asshole...

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:35.670
他们没一个生来有屁眼
wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.440
-预算太少了  -我了解
-The budget's stretched thin as it is.  -I see.

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:43.080
我可以写信跟州议会要钱
Maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:47.380
监狱领到款只能做三种用途
They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:50.020
筑高墙  加牢笼  添警卫
More walls, more bars, more guards.

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.890
我仍请您恩准  一周一信
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:55.820
-总会有结果  -难说哦
-They can't ignore me forever.  -Sure can.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.760
想写就写吧
But you write your letters if it makes you happy.

00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.660
我一定寄出  行吗？
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.130
安迪开始一周一信
So Andy started writing a letter a week...

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.930
他说话算话
just like he said.

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:14.740
不过  就像诺顿说的
And like Norton said...

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:16.440
毫无回音
Andy got no answers.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:29.530
次年  他替半数的警卫报税
The following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.130
再过一年  全都找他帮忙
Year after that, he did them all...

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:35.300
包括典狱长的
including the warden's.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.490
再过一年  狱际棒球赛
Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season...

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:43.140
改在与税季重叠
to coincide with tax season.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:49.170
各监狱的警卫都带税单找他
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.710
狱方发枪给你
So Moresby Prison...

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.180
但要你付钱
issued you a gun, but you paid for it.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.110
连枪套也要我付
Right. The holster too.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.810
这笔钱可以扣除
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:01.020
没错  安迪就像开小作坊
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:06.220
税季繁忙时  还可请帮手
In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.990
请帮我拿一叠表格
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:14.000
每年此时我调离工厂  乐到心坎里
Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:18.400
至于信  他仍继续寄
And still, he kept sending those letters.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.210
瑞德  安迪  老布出事了
It's Brooks.

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:28.840
守着门
Watch the door.

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:30.420
冷静点  老布
Please, Brooks.

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:32.490
-冲动个啥  -混帐  退后
-Calm the fuck down.  -Stay back!

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:35.550
-都退后  -怎么回事？
-Stay back, goddamn it!  -What's going on?

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.320
上一秒好好的  突然亮刀子
One second he's fine, then out come the knives.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:40.330
老布  有话好说
We can talk about this, right?

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:44.330
放屁  没啥可说  我要割断他喉咙
There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.330
等一下  赫伍哪里不对？
What's he done to you?

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.200
错在他们
It's what they done!

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:49.970
我别无选择
I got no choice.

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.740
谁都知道你不会伤害他
You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.

00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:55.440
-对  是吧赫伍？  -没错
-Right, Heywood?  -Sure.

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:58.980
因为他是朋友  而你明理
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.020
-对不对？
Right, guys?

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:03.810
老布  看着我  放下刀
So put the knife down. Look at me.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.290
把刀放下
Put the knife down.

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:10.320
老布  你瞧他的脖子
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:13.400
看看  都流血了
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.790
只有闯祸……
It's the only way...

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.030
才能留在牢里
they'd let me stay.

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.670
怎么可能  别做傻事
This is crazy. You don't want to do this.

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:22.970
把刀放下
Put it, put it down.

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:33.240
放松点
Take it easy.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.480
不会有事的
You'll be all right.

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:38.150
他没事  我呢？
Him? What about me?

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.720
老疯狗差点割断我喉咙
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:42.830
你刮胡子不也刀刀见血
You've had worse from shaving.

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:45.120
你怎么惹毛他的？
What did you do to set him off?

00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.560
哪有  我只是来道别
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:50.830
上面准他假释了
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.970
我实在搞不明白
I just don't understand what happened in there.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.970
这老家伙简直疯了
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.080
赫伍  住口
That's enough out of you.

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.010
-听说你吓的屁滚尿流  -滚你的
-Heard he had you shitting your pants. -Fuck you.

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.480
别斗嘴了
Knock it off.

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:07.890
老布没疯
Brooks ain't no bug.

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.410
他只是……
he is just...

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.490
体制化了
institutionalized.

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.800
“体制化”？  什么鸟词儿
"Institutionalized," my ass.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.990
他坐了50年的牢  赫伍  50年呀
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.930
成了井底之蛙
This is all he knows.

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.430
他念过书
In here, he's an important man...

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.730
在狱中有地位
an educated man.

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:29.470
出狱就成了废人
Outside, he's nothing.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:33.840
双手犯关节炎的囚徒
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:37.040
想向图书馆借书都会被拒
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.050
这样说你懂吗？
You know what I'm trying to say?

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.220
我才不懂你的满嘴屁话
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:45.720
随你怎么想吧
You believe whatever you want.

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:48.730
监狱是怪地方
But I tell you these walls are funny.

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:51.990
起先你恨它
First you hate them.

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:55.730
然后习惯它
Then you get used to them.

00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:59.660
更久后
Enough time passes...

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.330
你离不开它
you get so you depend on them.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.540
这就叫“体制化”
That's "institutionalized."

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.040
狗屎
Shit.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.010
-我才不会呢  -是吗？
-I could never get like that. -Oh, yeah?

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.370
等你呆到老布那把年纪 你就知道了
Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.180
说的太对了
Goddamn right.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.690
他们把你送到这里来度日
They send you here for life...

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.690
等于拿走你一生的年华
that's exactly what they take.

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.420
至少是一大部分
Part that counts, anyway.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.980
杰克  我无法再照顾你
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.810
走吧  你自由了
You go on now.

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.540
自由了
You're free.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.370
自由了
You're free.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.070
一切顺利  老布
Good luck, Brooksie.

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.430
保重

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.530
“亲爱的牢友：”
Dear fellas:

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:50.010
“外头的变化快得难以置信。”
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.980
老头儿  嫌命长吗
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.710
“小时候我只看过一辆汽车，”
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid...

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.790
“如今满街都是，”
but now they're everywhere.

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:09.770
“整个世界忙成一团。”
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:29.350
“上面安排我”
The parole board got me into this halfway house...

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.320
“到‘中途之家’，”
called "The Brewer"...

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.680
“并在超市”
and a job...

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:35.860
“当包装员。”
bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.830
“工作辛苦，我也卖力，”
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.400
“但双手一直犯疼。”
..but my hands hurt most of the time.

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.670
叫他务必用双层袋
Make sure your man double-bags.

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:46.900
上次差点撑破袋子
Last time, the bottom near came out.

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:50.510
确定要用双层袋
Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. understand?

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:52.080
是  没问题
Yes, sir. Surely will.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.810
“店长不怎么喜欢我。”
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.120
“工作之余我去公园喂鸟，”
Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.050
“盼望……”
I keep thinking...

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:08.620
“杰克来打个招呼，”
Jake might just show up and say hello.

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:11.220
“但它没出现过。”
But he never does.

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:17.300
“不管它在何处，我祝它过的好、有新朋友。”
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.

01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:23.640
“我夜间难以入眠，”
I have trouble sleeping at night.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.210
“做着从高处坠落的噩梦。”
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

“从梦中惊醒，”
I wake up scared.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.150
“有时记不起身在何方。”
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:40.560
“也许我该持枪抢劫，好让他们送我回去。”
Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:45.190
“我可以打死那个店长，当作额外奖励。”
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:50.860
“但我老的无法再胡闹了。”
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.830
“我不喜欢这里，”
I don't like it here.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.030
“我厌倦成天担惊受怕。”
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.540
“于是，我决心不再逗留。”
not to stay.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:13.020
“当局不会在乎我，”
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:16.720

not for an old crook like me.

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:23.460
“当局不会在乎我，一个糟老头算什么。”
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.

“还有，替我向赫伍道歉，”
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:30.870
“别记恨在心。你们的老布”
No hard feelings. Brooks."

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:43.320
他还不如老死在肖申克好
He should have died in here.

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:50.250
瞧瞧你干的好事
What the fuck have you done?

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:53.120
一片混乱
It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:02.400
-这些是什么？  -你说呢  全是寄给你的
-What's all this?  -You tell me. They're addressed to you.

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:05.000
看下这个
Take it.

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:15.040
“杜弗伦先生：”
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.150
“鉴于你再三询问，”
In response to your inquiries...

01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:22.620
“本州特拨款给贵图书馆。”
the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project."

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:25.220
有两百元
This is $ 200.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.420
“另外，主管单位”
"In addition, the library district has generously responded...

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:32.190
“特地捐赠旧书及杂物，”
with a donation of used books and sundries.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:36.530
“相信可满足阁下需要，就此了结，”
We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.530
“勿再来信。”
Please stop sending us letters."

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:41.430
典狱长回来前清理干净
Clear all this out before the warden gets back.

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:42.830
是
Yes, sir.

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:48.270
干的好  安迪
Good for you, Andy.

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.380
哇！
Wow!

01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:55.520
只写了六年
It only took six years.

01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:59.820
现在起我一周两封
From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.

01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:03.360
你真够固执的  听队长的话
I believe you're crazy enough.  Get this stuff out...

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.060
把东西清干净  我去解大便
like he said. I've got to pinch a loaf.

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:07.760
别让我出来
When I come back...

01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:09.700
再看到这些
this is all gone, all right?

01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.850
安迪  什么声音？
Do you hear that?

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:09.750
杜弗伦
Dufresne!

01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:13.820
安迪  放我出去！
Andy, let me out!

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.160
安迪！
Andy!

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:25.640
到现在我还搞不懂她们唱什么
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:28.170
其实我也不想弄懂
Truth is, I don't want to know.

01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:30.870
此时无言胜有言
Some things are best left unsaid.

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:37.180
她们唱出
I like to think it was something so beautiful...

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.510
难以言传的美
it can't be expressed in words...

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.620
美得令你心碎
and makes your heart ache because of it.

01:09:44.290 --> 01:09:46.780
歌声直窜云端
I tell you, those voices soared...

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:51.360
超越失意囚徒的梦想
higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.930
宛如小鸟飞入牢房
It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage...

01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:57.900
使石墙消失无踪
and made those walls dissolve away.

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.530
就在这一瞬间
And for the briefest of moments...

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:03.730
肖申克众囚仿佛重获自由
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:08.970
典狱长可发飚了
It pissed the warden off something awful.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.270
开门
Open the door.

01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:15.950
开门
Open it up!

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:19.990
杜弗伦  开门
Dufresne, open this door!

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:22.520
关掉
Turn that off!

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.040
我警告你  关掉
I am warning you. Turn that off!

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:48.120
杜弗伦
Dufresne!

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:51.310
敬酒不吃吃罚酒
You're mine now.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.000
安迪被关禁闭两周
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.790
站起来
On your feet.

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.370
-看谁来了  -大指挥家
-Hey, look who's here.  -Maestro!

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.800
你没别的可放吗？  比如汉克·威廉斯的歌？
You couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?

01:11:13.150 --> 01:11:15.940
没等接受点歌  他们就破门而入了
They broke the door down before I could take requests.

01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:19.280
-关两周值得吗？  -我最舒服的两周
-Was it worth two weeks?  -Easiest time I ever did.

01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:23.680
-屁话  关小号最难熬了  -在里面度日如年

-Damn straight.  -I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:30.360
他们准你带留声机？
So they let you tote that record player down there, huh?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.160
在脑中
It was in here.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.230
在心底
In here.

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.460
音乐之美
That's the beauty of music.

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:42.000
是夺不走的
They can't get that from you.

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.910
你没体会过吗？
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.840
我年轻时吹过口琴
Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:55.580
后来没兴致了
Lost interest in it, though.

01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:57.380
在牢里也没意义
Didn't make much sense in here.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.710
就是在这里才有意义
Here's where it makes the most sense.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.320
有音乐才不会忘记
You need it so you don't forget.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.090
忘记什么？
Forget?

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.560
世上
Forget that there are...

01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:09.200
有些地方
places...

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.540
是石墙围不住的
in the world that aren't made out of stone.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.030
在人的
There's something...

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.770
内心深处
inside...

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.010
有他们找不到
that they can't get to...

01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:21.580
拿不走的东西
that they can't touch.

01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:23.550
完全属于你自己的东西
That's yours.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.680
你指什么？
What are you talking about?

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.950
希望
Hope.

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.350
希望

01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:35.280
朋友  我告诉你
Let me tell you something, my friend.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.390
有希望才危险
Hope is a dangerous thing.

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:41.900
希望能把人逼疯
Hope can drive a man insane.

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:44.760
在这里  希望毫无用处
It's got no use on the inside.

01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:47.170
你最好认命
You'd better get used to that idea.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.170
要像老布一样吗？
Like Brooks did?

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.520
坐下
Sit down.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.170
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满30年
Says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.

01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:29.410
你改过自新了吗？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.840
是的
Oh, yes, sir.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.450
我真的已经变好了
Without a doubt.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.020
我完全洗心革面了
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.070
30年了
Thirty years.

01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:02.950
老天  真不知该说什么？
Jesus, when you say it like that...

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.610
这些日子怎么熬过来的
You wonder where it went.

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:10.210
我连前十年都不记得了
I wonder where 10 years went.

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.220

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.370
漂亮极了
It's very pretty.

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:43.280
谢谢
Thank you.

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.350

You going to play it?

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.160
不
No.

01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:58.170

59年  州议会终于明白
In 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact...

01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:43.800
两百元无法打发安迪
they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.

01:16:44.010 --> 01:16:48.310
当局决定每年拨款五百美元
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500...

01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:50.410
好让安迪封笔
just to shut him up.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:53.610

01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:57.630

我听说这种派他收过很多
He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:18.410
你听说的只是皮毛  他干的坏事你根本想不到  重重的回扣
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

黑钱如河般在他脚下流
A river of dirty money running through here.

01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:25.020

Sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:26.990

诺顿退休时  将是百万富翁

他不存在  除了在文件上
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

01:22:43.670 --> 01:22:46.030
哪有凭空造人的？
You can't just make a person up.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.330
利用制度的漏洞就行
Sure you can, if you know how the system works.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.670

01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:02.820
就算抓到蛛丝马迹
If they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing...

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.750
也等于捕风捉影
a figment of my imagination.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.950
真想不到
Well, I'll be damned!

01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:10.020
我有称赞过你吧？
Did I say you were good?

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.020
你简直是大艺术家
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.490
可笑的是
The funny thing is...

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:18.800
在外头  我刚正不阿
on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.540
进了牢  却大搞欺骗
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:31.710
你担心过吗？
Ever bother you?

01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:36.210
我没干坏事  只是洗钱
I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.

01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:38.480
也许这是强词夺理
A fine line, maybe...

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.120
但我建起图书馆
but I also built that library...

01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:44.350
帮助囚友考取高中文凭
and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.790
典狱长凭什么放任不管？
Why do you think he lets me do all that?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.190
为了使你
IKeep you happy and doing the laundry.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.890
乐于帮他洗钱
Money instead of sheets.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.830
我算是便宜卖给他
Well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.

01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:13.720
汤米在65年来到肖申克
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.190
犯了“入室行窃”  判了两年
on a two-year stretch for B and E.

01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:18.760
就是强行侵入他人公宅
That's breaking and entering to you.

01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:23.260
他在商店后门偷彩电时被逮
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.000
小朋克
Young punk.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.830
摇滚狂一个
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.560
跩得够可爱
cocky as hell.

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:31.170
快点 老家伙们 慢得跟糖浆一样
Come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!

01:24:31.410 --> 01:24:33.170
我看了难过
Making me look bad.

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:35.180
人见人爱
We liked him immediately.

01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:39.140
我退出门外  就这样抱着电视
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:43.080
它很大  害我看不见  忽然传来
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.690
“别动，举起手来！”
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:50.350
我站着抱紧电视
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.360
他又说  “你听到没有？”  我说  “听到，但我若松手，”
"You hear what I said, boy?" I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:58.020
“就要添一条毁坏财产罪。”
But if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too."

01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:04.810
你在凯希曼监狱蹲过？
You done some stretch in Cashman, right?

01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:09.270
那儿要好过得多
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.

01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:11.480
周末回家  活也轻松
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:12.740
不像这里
Not like here.

01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:15.390
你哪里都蹲过嘛
Sounds like you done time all over.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:18.220
我13岁起以牢为家
I've been in and out since I was 13.

01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:20.620
你叫得上名的监狱我都待过
Name it, chances are I've been there.

01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:23.490
也许你该改行了
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:26.490
依我看
What I mean is...

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:30.270
你的贼功不灵光  该做做别的事
you're not a very good thief.You should try something else.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.730
你懂个屁  你是卡彭？
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:35.730
你因何入狱？
What are you in for?

01:25:36.010 --> 01:25:37.000
我？
Me?

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.110
被律师害了
A lawyer fucked me.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:47.990
肖申克没人有罪  你不知道？
Everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?

01:25:55.890 --> 01:26:00.300
汤米有娇妻和刚出生的女儿
As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.

01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:02.990
他怕妻女流落街头
Maybe he thought of them on the streets...

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.690
到头来不认识老爸
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.370
或是别的什么原因
Whatever it was...

01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:10.140
反正这小子卯上了
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:16.850
我想考高中文凭
Thought I might try for my high school equivalency.

01:26:17.050 --> 01:26:19.570
听说你帮过人
Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.150
我不帮废柴
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:27.050
我才不是废柴
I ain't no goddamn loser.

01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:30.620
-你当真？  -对
-You mean that?  -Yeah.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:33.730
真的当真？
You really mean that?

01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:36.130
真的
Yes, sir, I do.

01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:38.300
好  要冲就冲到底
Good. Because if we do this...

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.460
百分之百努力  不可半途而废
we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:44.500
问题是……
Thing is, see...

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:47.300
我不太识字
I don't read so good.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.570
好吧
Well.

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.310
你不太识字……
You don't read...

01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:55.080
没关系
so well.

01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.910
交给我吧
We'll get to that.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.490
安迪收汤米为徒
So, Andy took Tommy under his wing.

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.330
从字母教起
Started walking him through his ABC's.

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:12.660
汤米学得非常好
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:15.700
他从未发现自己有天份
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.480
没多久就开始准备考试
Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.340
安迪真心喜欢他
He really liked the kid.

01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:27.110
助人向上令他兴奋
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.880
但动机不止于此
But that wasn't the only reason.

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:32.780
牢狱生活漫长得很
Prison time is slow time.

01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.850
必须找事打发时间
So you do what you can to keep going.

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:38.250
有人集邮
Some fellas collect stamps.

01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:41.150
有人盖火柴屋
Others build matchstick houses.

01:27:41.730 --> 01:27:44.400
安迪成立了图书馆
Andy built a library.

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:46.840
如今他需要新事由
Now he needed a new project.

01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:49.200
那就是汤米
Tommy was it.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.830
这跟他长年刻石一样
It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.

01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:57.610
也跟他挂美女图一样
The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.780
在牢里
In prison...

01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:03.780
没事也得找事做
a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.420
1966年  就在汤米应考之前
By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.860
换上拉寇儿·薇芝了
it was lovely Raquel.

01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:29.400
时间到
Time.

01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:36.440
怎样？
Well?

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:40.180
烂透了
Well, it's for shit.

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:43.520
我他妈白费一整年
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.

01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:45.220
也许没那么糟
It's probably not that bad.

01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:49.660
就没一道题做对  简直像看中文
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.

01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:51.600
分数出来再说
Let's see how the score comes out.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.770
我告诉你几分吧
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.

01:28:56.710 --> 01:28:58.070
两分投篮
Two points, right there!

01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.830
这就是该死的成绩
There's your goddamn score!

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.780
什么猫爬树  五五二十五
Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:06.340
去他妈的这鬼地方
Fuck this place!

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:07.710
去他妈的
Fuck it!

01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:28.130
真后悔
I feel bad.

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:29.530
让他失望了
I let him down.

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.470
胡说
That's crap, kid.

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.010
他以你为荣
He's proud of you.

01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:36.210
多年的交情  我摸透他了
We're old friends,I know him as good as anybody.

01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:37.970
他是聪明人
Smart fellow, ain't he?

01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:41.310
绝顶聪明  曾是银行家
Smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.750
他究竟为何入狱?
What's he in here for anyway?

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:45.040
谋杀
Murder.

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.890
你少扯了
The hell, you say.

01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:52.360
看他外表是想不到
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:57.690
捉到老婆跟高尔夫球教练在床  两个全干掉了
Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.

01:30:05.710 --> 01:30:06.700
怎么了？
What?

01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:10.610
大约四年前
About four years ago...

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.110
我在托马斯顿监狱服刑
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:15.920
我偷了车
I stole a car.

01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:18.280
实在愚蠢
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.190
刑期还剩半年时
About six months left to go...

01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:23.390
来了个新室友
I get a new cellmate in.

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.720
厄摩·布拉奇
Elmo Blatch.

01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:27.760
混蛋一个  大个子  神经质
Big, twitchy fucker.

01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:32.130
谁都怕碰上这种室友  明白我的意思吧
IKind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?

01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:35.070
持械抢劫  服刑6至12年
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.600
他说他干过好几百票
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:42.750
想不到有那么神经的人  你放个响屁  他都能离地三尺
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:48.440
他的嘴永远闭不上
Talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.

01:30:48.650 --> 01:30:50.280
他去过的地方
Places he'd been in...

01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:53.650
犯过的罪行  玩过的女人
jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

01:30:53.890 --> 01:30:56.090
甚至杀过的人
Even people he killed.

01:30:57.330 --> 01:31:00.130
他说杀人
People who "gave him shit."

01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:02.320
只是因为不爽
That's how he put it.

01:31:03.630 --> 01:31:07.000
有一晚  就当玩笑
So one night, like a joke...

01:31:08.110 --> 01:31:11.600
我问他  “你杀过谁？”
I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?"

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:12.930
他说——
So he says:

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:17.100
我在俱乐部收盘子
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club...

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:21.680
趁机观察阔人下手
so I could case all these bigrich pricks that come in.

01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:25.780
我相中一人
So I pick out this guy...

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:28.250
在晚上
go in one night...

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:30.190
摸进他家
and do his place.

01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:32.960
他醒来
He wakes up...

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.460
惹得我不爽
and gives me shit.

01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:38.200
我就杀了他
So I killed him.

01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:42.800
和他身边那骚货
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:46.470
精彩的是
And that's the best part.

01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.640
虽搞上这个高尔夫球教练
She's fucking this prick, see...

01:31:49.810 --> 01:31:52.870
她却是个有夫之妇
this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.040
她老公  一个大银行家
Some hotshot banker.

01:31:57.490 --> 01:31:59.980
成了替罪羊
And he's the one they pinned it on.

01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:15.340
我从未听过如此惊人的故事
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:19.100
最惊人的是你居然受骗
What amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.830
什么？
Sir?

01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:26.640
显然汤米对你颇有好感
It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:31.190
知道你很痛苦  自然想让你高兴
He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.

01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:33.550
他还年轻  脑筋不太灵光
He's young, not terribly bright.

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:37.530
根本不明白这反而会害苦了你
It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.

01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:39.490
先生  他说的是实情
Sir, he's telling the truth.

01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:44.430
就算真有厄摩这人
Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:49.330
难道他会跪地哭诉  “是我杀的，我忏悔，”
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:52.240
“顺便再给我加个无期徒刑吧。”
By the way, add a life term to my sentence."

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.240
只要有汤米的证词 我就可以要求重审
With Tommy's testimony,I can get a new trial.

01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:57.940
但你得找到厄摩
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

01:32:58.150 --> 01:33:00.080
他可能早就出狱了
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:04.880
应该能查到住址  这可是机会
They'd have his last known address.It's a chance, isn't it?

01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.950
你真是个木头
How can you be so obtuse?

01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:10.880
什么？
What?

你说我什么？
What did you call me?

01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:15.790
你笨蛋  我说错了吗？
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

01:33:16.170 --> 01:33:17.660
你别忘了身份
You're forgetting yourself.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.940
俱乐部有厄摩的考勤卡
The country club will have his old timecards.

你爱幻想  那是你的事
If you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.

01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:29.610
别给我添麻烦  面谈结束
Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.

01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:32.410
我若出狱  绝不提你的事
If I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.

01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:36.020
因为洗钱  与你同罪
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.

01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:40.820
不许你提钱这个字  混账东西
Don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!

01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:42.690
办公室里不许提

01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:57.230
这是我重获自由的机会  我的人生转机  你不懂吗？
This is my chance to get out! It's my life! Understand?!

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.500
带出去
Get him out!

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.250
小号  一个月
A month in the hole.

01:34:03.450 --> 01:34:06.140
从没听过这么严厉的惩罚
That's the longest stretch I ever heard of.

01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:07.650
都是我不对
It's all my fault.

01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:09.440
胡说八道
Bullshit.

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.820
你没杀人  也没判安迪的罪
You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.420
你是说安迪没罪？
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:17.650
他真的无辜？
I mean, for real innocent?

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.190
看来是这样
It looks that way.

01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:21.530
我的天
Sweet Jesus.

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.630
他服刑多久了？
How long has he been here now?

01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:27.300
47年进来  19年了
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:30.130
-汤米的信  -我在这
-Williams, Thomas.  -Yeah, over here.

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.140

教育委员会来的
Board of Education.

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.390
-老小子寄出那考卷了  -看来是
-That son of a bitch mailed it. -Likely he did.

01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:45.010
你是要拆开  还是就这么拿着傻看？
You going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?

01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:47.380
拿着傻看好些
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:50.730
把它还给我  你他妈的
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:52.890
福洛

把它丢掉  好吗？
Will you throw that away, please?

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.070
狗屎  不赖

典狱长找你谈话
Warden wants to talk.

01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:58.350
在这儿？
Out here?

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.790
他就是这样说的
That's what the man said.

01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:17.900
典狱长？
Warden?

01:36:18.850 --> 01:36:19.780
汤米？

01:36:26.290 --> 01:36:31.990
汤米  这次会面要你保密
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.760
我良心深感不安
I feel awkward enough as it is.

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.280
他的判决出了问题
We got a situation here.

01:36:57.150 --> 01:36:59.250
我想你明白
I think you can appreciate that.

01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:00.680
是的
Yes, sir.

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:02.360
我明白
I sure can.

01:37:02.630 --> 01:37:06.650
这件事真使我震惊
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.

01:37:08.130 --> 01:37:10.690
我连觉都睡不好
It's got me up nights.That's the truth.

01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:14.800
我该怎么做才好
The right thing to do...

01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:20.200
有时连我也搞不清楚
sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:22.640
你了解吗？
Do you understand?

01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:26.540
我需要你的协助  孩子
I need your help, son.

01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:30.150
我要有……
If I'm going to move on this...

01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:33.650
十足把握才能翻案
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:35.450
我得知道
I have to know...

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:38.290
你所说是否实话
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:39.620
是的
Yes, sir.

01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:41.060
字字属实
Absolutely.

01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:44.560
你愿在法官及陪审团前宣誓
Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...

01:37:44.770 --> 01:37:46.760
并且手按圣经
with your hand on the Good Book...

01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:49.630
在上帝跟前起誓吗？
and take an oath before Almighty God himself?

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.640
只要给我这个机会
Just give me that chance.

01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:57.240
我也这样想
That's what I thought.

01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:46.230
相信你已听说了
I'm sure by now you've heard.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.020
真惨
Terrible thing.

01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:52.120
年纪轻轻
A man that young...

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:55.030
刑期剩下不到一年还要逃
less than a year to go, trying to escape.

01:38:55.570 --> 01:38:58.060
射杀他令海利伤透心
Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

01:38:58.810 --> 01:39:00.300
千真万确
Truly, it did.

01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:05.750
我们只有忘掉这事
We just have to put it behind us.

01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:08.650
继续过日子
Move on.

01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:11.740
到此为止
I'm done.

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.680
我不干了
Everything stops.

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:18.990
你找别人帮你骗钱吧
Get someone else to run your scams.

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:22.100
一切照旧
Nothing stops.

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:24.590
一切
Nothing.

01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:31.100
否则我要你生不如死
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:33.810
不再让警卫保护你
No more protection from the guards.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.950
不再让你一人一间牢房  把你丢到鸡奸狂当中
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.780
日日夜夜轮奸不休
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:45.680
图书馆呢？
And the library?

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.350
没了
Gone.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:50.520
用砖头封死
Sealed off, brick by brick.

01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:53.660
在操场焚书
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:55.990
几里外都看得见火光
They'll see the flames for miles.

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.030
大家围着火跳红蕃舞
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:03.300
听懂了吗？
You understand me? Catching my drift?

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.910
我是笨蛋吗？
Or am I being obtuse?

01:40:20.690 --> 01:40:23.320
再关他一个月  考虑清楚
Give him another month to think about it.

01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:13.130
老婆说她很难了解我
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:15.780
像一本合起来的书
Like a closed book.

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.610
她整天这样抱怨
Complained about it all the time.

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:21.110
她很漂亮
She was beautiful.

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.040
我那么爱她
God, I loved her.

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.990
我只是不擅表达
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:35.390
是我杀了她
I killed her, Red.

01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:39.060
枪不是我开的
I didn't pull the trigger...

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.230
但我害她离我远去
but I drove her away.

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:46.440
是我的脾气秉性
That's why she died, because of me...

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.010
害死了她
the way I am.

01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:58.850
但你不是杀人犯
That don't make you a murderer.

01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:03.990
只能说是差丈夫
Bad husband, maybe.

01:42:07.630 --> 01:42:10.900
可以后悔  但你无罪
Feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.430
没错
No, I didn't.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.770
别人干的
Somebody else did.

01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:18.100
却由我受罚
And I wound up in here.

01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:22.170
大概是我命薄
Bad luck, I guess.

01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:29.030
谁都可能
It floats around.

01:42:29.850 --> 01:42:32.080
沾染霉运
It's got to land on somebody.

01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:34.890
刚好轮到我
It was my turn, that's all.

01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:38.360
我被卷入龙卷风
I was in the path of the tornado.

01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:48.260
只是没想到刮了这么久
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.

01:42:52.610 --> 01:42:54.300
你有可能假释吗？
Think you'll ever get out of here?

01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:56.570
我？
Me?

01:42:59.550 --> 01:43:00.540
有吧
Yeah.

01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:04.180
要等我老得发须花白
One day, when I got a long, white beard...

01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:08.480
神智不清才行
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.

01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:11.220
我跟你说我要去哪儿
I tell you where I'd go.

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:14.360
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:16.430
哪里？
Say what?

01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:18.560
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.160
在墨西哥
It's in Mexico.

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.670
太平洋边的小地方
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:29.750
-知道墨西哥人怎样说太平洋的吗？  -不知道
-You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? -No.

01:43:30.410 --> 01:43:32.410
那是没有回忆的海洋
They say it has no memory.

01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:37.050
我要在那度此余生
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

01:43:38.690 --> 01:43:41.180
没有回忆的温暖地
A warm place with no memory.

01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:46.360
在海边
Open up a little hotel...

01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:49.560
开个小旅馆
right on the beach.

01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:52.360
买条破船
Buy some worthless old boat...

01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:54.530
整修一新
and fix it up new.

01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:58.500
载客出海
Take my guests out...

01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:00.710
包船海钓
charter fishing.

01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:06.280
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:13.690
你在那地方也大有可为
In a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.

01:44:20.230 --> 01:44:23.060
我在外头吃不开的
I don't think I could make it on the outside.

01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:31.800
我一生都耗在肖申克
I been in here most of my life.

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.010
我已经体制化了
I'm an institutional man now.

01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:37.640
就像老布
Just like Brooks was.

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.810
你别小看自己
You underestimate yourself.

01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:42.980
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:50.760
我在牢里让你有求必应
In here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...

01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:54.050
一出社会  电话簿里样样有
outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.490
但我连查都不会查
Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.260
太平洋？
Pacific Ocean?

01:45:00.670 --> 01:45:01.900
狗屁
Shit.

01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:04.470
大的我心都毛了
Scare me to death, something that big.

01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:05.970
我不会
Not me.

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:09.940
老婆和她情夫不是我杀的
I didn't shoot my wife,and I didn't shoot her lover.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.910
我犯的错已还清
Whatever mistakes I made,I've paid for them and then some.

01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:17.440
一间旅店  一叶扁舟
That hotel, that boat...

01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:21.450
要求并不过份
I don't think that's too much to ask.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.800
你不该有此妄想
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.020
完全痴人说梦
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:33.960
墨西哥和这儿
Mexico is way down there and you're in here...

01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:35.700
天南地北
and that's the way it is.

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.870
说的没错
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:42.780
远隔天涯海角
It's down there and I'm in here.

01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:48.080
我猜是人就得二选一
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:52.480
要么忙着活……
Get busy living...

01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:55.880
要么忙着死
or get busy dying.

01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:00.690
安迪
Andy.

01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:05.560
瑞德
Red.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.730
等你假释后  帮我个忙
If you ever get out of here,do me a favor.

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:13.210
没问题  你说
Sure, Andy. Anything.

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.950
巴克斯顿有个大草场  知道巴克斯顿吗？
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.You know where Buxton is?

01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:23.550
-那一带草场多得很  -有一处与众不同
-A lot of hayfields up there. -One in particular.

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:27.690
那里有长石墙  北端还有大橡树
It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.

01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:30.760
美得像福斯特的诗
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:34.190
我在那儿向她求婚
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.690
我们去野餐
We went there for a picnic...

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:40.190
在橡树下做爱
and made love under that oak...

01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:43.100
我开口  她首肯
and I asked and she said yes.

01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:48.940
答应我  瑞德
Promise me, Red.

01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:51.410
如果你终获假释
If you ever get out...

01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.110
去找到那个地方
find that spot.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:59.120
石墙底下有一块奇石
At the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.

01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:03.280
黑色火山玻璃石
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.620
底下埋着给你的东西
Something's buried under it I want you to have.

01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.630
是什么？
What, Andy?

01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:12.800
你埋着什么？
What's buried under there?

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.270
你搬开它
You'll have to pry it up...

01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:17.740
就知道了
to see.

01:47:23.650 --> 01:47:25.580
你们听我说
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

01:47:26.250 --> 01:47:27.980
他胡言乱语
He's talking funny.

01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:30.780
我真担心他
I'm really worried about him.

01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:32.620
我们要盯紧他
Let's keep an eye on him.

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:36.090
白天不要紧  晚上孤伶伶的
That's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.

01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:38.650
天哪
Oh, Lord.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.590
怎么了？
What?

01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:45.100
安迪今天到载货区
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:47.400
问我要一条绳子
He asked me for a length of rope.

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:50.300
-绳子？  -六尺长
Rope? Six feet long.

01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:51.910
你给了他？
And you gave it to him.

01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:54.570
为什么不给？
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:58.710
-天啊  赫伍  -我怎么想得到？
-Jesus! Heywood. -How was I supposed to know?

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:00.670
你忘了老布？
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

01:48:00.850 --> 01:48:04.620
不  安迪不会寻短
Andy would never do that.

01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:06.280
绝对不会
Never.

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:09.690
谁知道呢？
I don't know.

01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:14.550
人的忍耐是有限度的
Every man has his breaking point.

01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:19.160
动作快  我要回家
Lickety-split.Want to get home.

01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:21.230
马上好了
Just about finished, sir.

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:39.980
今晚要存三笔
Three deposits tonight.

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.860
把衣物送洗
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:51.690
把鞋擦亮
And shine my shoes.

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:54.840
-要擦得雪亮  -是  先生
-I want them looking like mirrors. -Yes, sir.

01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:01.830
你回来真好  安迪
It's good having you back.

01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:04.610
没有你可差多了
Place wasn't the same without you.

01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:52.550
熄灯
Lights out!

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.920
我也曾熬过孤寂长夜
I've had some long nights in stir.

01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:31.130
独自在心中思东想西
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts...

01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:34.000
时间慢得如同刀割
time can draw out like a blade.

01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:42.330
那是我毕生最长的一夜
That was the longest night of my life.

01:50:58.190 --> 01:50:59.350
清点人数！
Give me a count!

01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:07.670
-南三层到齐  -北四层到齐
Tier 3 south, clear!

01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:09.630
北三层到齐

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:13.000
二层245没人
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

01:51:13.210 --> 01:51:14.270
杜弗伦
Dufresne!

01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:17.250
快出来 别耍花样
Come out. You're holding up the show!

01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.780
等我找上门  可就重赏你的脑袋了
Don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:35.200
该死  我还得等你一个  你敢耽搁我时间
Damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.

01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.700
你最好是病了或是死了
You'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!

01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:40.230
听见没有？
You hear me?

01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:48.440
噢  我的上帝
Oh, my Holy God.

01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:07.990
这一分区每人都要问
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.

01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:10.990
-先从他朋友开始  -谁？
-Start with that friend of his. -Who?

01:52:11.170 --> 01:52:12.570
他
Him.

01:52:13.570 --> 01:52:15.130
打开237
Open 237.

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:22.300
什么叫“他不见了”？  这算什么鬼话？
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:24.510
你再说一次试试
Don't tell me that again.

01:52:24.710 --> 01:52:25.740
但他真的不见了
But sir, he wasn't.

01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:29.440
我没长眼睛吗？
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.520
你是这个意思？
Is that what you're saying?

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:34.380
-我眼瞎了？  -不敢  长官
-Am I blind, Haig? -No, sir!

01:52:35.290 --> 01:52:37.780
你呢？ 你瞎了吗？
What about you. You blind?

01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:40.850
-你说这是什么？  -昨晚的点名记录
-Tell me what this is. -Last night's count.

01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:44.360
上面明明写着杜弗伦
You see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.

01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:45.900
“杜弗伦”
"Dufresne."

01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:49.060
熄灯时
He was in his cell...

01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:50.300
他在牢里
at lights out.

01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:53.410
早上应该也在才对
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:55.370
把他找到
I want him found.

01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:59.040
一刻不能拖  现在就找！
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:00.480
是  长官
Yes, sir.

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:05.280
搜人去  快点
Let's go. Move your butts.

01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:08.150
站好
Stand.

01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:10.650
你说
Well?

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:15.090
说什么？
Well, what?

01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:18.760
你们俩成天粘在一起
I see you two all the time.You're thick as thieves, you are.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.330
他一定说过什么
He must have said something.

01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:23.600
报告典狱长
No, sir, Warden.

01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:24.930
没有
Not a word.

01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:29.340
那真是奇迹了
Lord, it's a miracle!

01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:32.510
人像屁一样凭空消失
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:34.340
不见踪影
Nothing left...

01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:37.910
只剩一堆石头
but some damn rocks on a windowsill.

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:40.850
还有墙上那骚货  问问她吧
And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.

01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:42.820
也许她知道些什么
Maybe she knows.

01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:45.790
你来说  短裤妞儿
What say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?

01:53:47.230 --> 01:53:48.530
她不会说的
Guess not.

01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:51.290
别人不说  为何她要说
Why should she be any different?

01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:54.030
没错  你们有预谋
This is a conspiracy.

01:53:54.670 --> 01:53:56.500
就是这样
That's what this is.

01:53:57.110 --> 01:54:00.840
一个超级大阴谋
One big, damn conspiracy!

01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:03.100
每个人都有份
And everyone's in on it!

01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:04.910
包括她
Including her!

01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:41.640
1966年
In 1966...

01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:44.250
安迪·杜弗伦逃离……
Andy Dufresne escaped...

01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:46.010
肖申克监狱
from Shawshank Prison.

01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:50.820
狱方只寻获泥渍囚衣
All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...

01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:52.990
一块肥皂
a bar of soap...

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:54.750
和一把石锤
and an old rock hammer...

01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:57.460
一把几乎解体的石锤
damn near worn down to the nub.

01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:06.710
我曾夸口要花六百年才能挖通的隧道
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.970
安迪花了不到20年
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:30.560
他喜爱研究地质
Oh, Andy loved geology.

01:55:31.330 --> 01:55:34.500
碎石令他想一探究竟
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:36.740
刑期如同
An ice age here...

01:55:37.170 --> 01:55:39.660
冰河时代
million years of mountain building there.

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:43.510
地质学探讨压力及时间
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:46.340
这就是凿通的关键——
That's all it takes, really.

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:48.180
压力
Pressure...

01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:50.080
时间
and time.

01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:53.480
和一张够大的海报
That and a big goddamn poster.

01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:58.450
就像我说的
Like I said...

01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:02.950
在牢里  没事也得找事做
in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.

01:56:05.770 --> 01:56:10.570
原来安迪的嗜好  就是把他的牢墙
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...

01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:13.040
一次一把地搬到操场上
a handful at a time.

01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:16.400
大概就在汤米死后
I guess after Tommy was killed...

01:56:16.610 --> 01:56:19.580
安迪决定不再久留
Andy decided he'd been here long enough.

01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:22.340
动作快  我要回家
Lickety-split.I want to get home.

01:56:23.090 --> 01:56:25.110
马上就好
I'm just about finished, sir.

01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:48.510
今晚要存三笔
Three deposits tonight.

01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:58.120
安迪奉命行事
Andy did like he was told.

01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:01.810
把鞋子擦得雪亮
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.

01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.790
警卫都没注意
The guards simply didn't notice.

01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:09.590
我也没有
Neither did I.

01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:11.290
说真的
I mean, seriously...

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:14.490
谁会注意别人的鞋子
how often do you really look at a man's shoes?

01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:21.220
安迪就这样爬向自由
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...

01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:24.800
在恶臭中匍匐五百码
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:28.130
换我才不干呢
Or maybe I just don't want to.

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:34.910
五百码
Five hundred yards.

01:59:35.410 --> 01:59:38.470
有五个足球场那么长
That's the length of five football fields.

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:41.680
接近半英里
Just shy of half a mile.

02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:41.500
次日清晨  在拉寇儿坦露她的秘密之时
The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret...

02:00:41.810 --> 02:00:44.640
一个从未现世的人
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.470
走进缅因国家银行
strolled into the Maine National Bank.

02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:51.210
在那之前  他不是实体
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:54.150
-只存在于文件上  -有何贵干？
-Except on paper. -May I help you?

02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:56.490
他各种证件都有
He had all the proper ID...

02:00:56.690 --> 02:01:00.390
驾照  出生证  社会保险卡
driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...

02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:03.360
签名分毫不差
And the signature was a spot-on match.

02:01:03.570 --> 02:01:06.660
失去您的生意令我真心遗憾
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.

02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:08.600
祝您侨居愉快
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:10.500
谢谢
Thank you.

02:01:11.170 --> 02:01:12.330
一定的
I'm sure I will.

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:16.580
这是银行本票  就这样吗？
Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?

02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:17.770
麻烦你
Please.

02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:20.840
帮我寄出去好吗？
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:22.540
乐意之至
I'd be happy to.

02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:25.680
-再会  -走好
-Good day, sir. -Good day.

02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:31.060
那天上午史帝文先后去了十多家银行
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.

02:01:31.530 --> 02:01:33.120
总共加起来
All told, he blew town...

02:01:33.330 --> 02:01:38.160
提走了诺顿37万美金
with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:41.630
作为十九年冤狱的补偿
Severance pay for 19 years.

02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:51.070
早上好 这里是《波特兰号角日报》
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

02:02:43.930 --> 02:02:46.870
你是海利吗？  你有权保持沉默
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.

02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:51.570
从现在起 你所说的一切 都将可能成为呈堂证供
If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.

02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:56.470
当时我没有在场  后来听说
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:58.170
海利被人带走的时候  哭得像个娘们儿
when they took him away.

02:03:04.050 --> 02:03:07.450
诺顿却无意乖乖就范
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

02:03:23.410 --> 02:03:24.770
诺顿
Samuel Norton.

02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:27.370
诺顿  我们有拘捕令  开门
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

02:03:30.810 --> 02:03:33.210
把门打开
Open the door.

02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:35.010
我不清楚是哪一把
I'm not sure which key.

02:03:44.690 --> 02:03:47.360
别自找麻烦  诺顿
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

02:03:58.610 --> 02:04:02.070
我猜他脑中最后一件事
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...

02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:03.870
除了枪子儿
other than that bullet...

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:08.520
就是在想安迪为何能整倒他
was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:14.480
典狱长呜呼后不久
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company...

02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:16.820
我收到一张明信片
I got a postcard in the mail.

02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:21.130
没写字  但有邮戳
It was blank, but the postmark said...

02:04:21.330 --> 02:04:23.460
来自德州汉考克堡
Fort Hancock, Texas.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.360
汉考克堡
Fort Hancock...

02:04:25.630 --> 02:04:27.360
就在边境线上
right on the border.

02:04:27.770 --> 02:04:29.760
安迪就是从那里出境的
That's where Andy crossed.

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:34.470
驾着敞蓬车驶向南方
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...

02:04:34.810 --> 02:04:37.040
想到这画面就令我开怀大笑
it always makes me laugh.

02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.440
安迪·杜弗伦
Andy Dufresne...

02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:42.840
爬过肮脏的下水道
who crawled through a river of shit...

02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:45.450
出来已焕然一新
and came out clean on the other side.

02:04:46.290 --> 02:04:47.650
安迪·杜弗伦
Andy Dufresne...

02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:50.050
向太平洋驶去
headed for the Pacific.

02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:55.190
海利掐住他喉咙说
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?

02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:59.200
“他活的不耐烦了。”
He says, "I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:02.270
老友们常聊起他
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.

02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:04.630
他那些惊人之举
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:07.810
“请我朋友喝啤酒吧……”
"My friends could use a couple of beers."

02:05:08.140 --> 02:05:09.800
他真的做到了！
And he got it!

02:05:11.050 --> 02:05:13.450
有时我会感伤
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:15.150
他的离去
Andy being gone.

02:05:15.850 --> 02:05:17.050
我不得不提醒自己
I have to remind myself that...

02:05:17.050 --> 02:05:18.980
有些鸟儿是注定不会被关在牢笼里的
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:22.520
它们的每一片羽毛都闪耀着自由的光辉
Their feathers are just too bright.

02:05:24.230 --> 02:05:25.960
当它们盘旋飞离之时
And when they fly away...

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:30.800
你会由衷地祝贺它们获得自由
the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:33.130
无奈的是
But still...

02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.940
你得继续在这乏味之地苟活
the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:44.510
我真怀念这位友伴
I guess I just miss my friend.

02:06:08.970 --> 02:06:10.130
请坐
Please sit down.

02:06:15.980 --> 02:06:17.540
埃利斯·博伊德·瑞丁
Ellis Boyd Redding...

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:21.350
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满40年
your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.

02:06:22.150 --> 02:06:24.280
你改过自新了吗？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:27.710
改过自新？
Rehabilitated?

02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:31.660
噢  让我想想
Well, now, let me see.

02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:34.990
我不大明白这个词的含义
I don't have any idea what that means.

02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.360
就是说准备好重返社会
It means you're ready to rejoin society...

02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:42.270
我当然明白你的意思  年轻人
I know what you think it means, sonny.

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.430
对我而言  这只是个术语
To me it's just a made-up word.

02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:50.110
政客发明的术语
A politician's word so that...

02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:54.070
好让你们穿西装打领带
young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...

02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:56.140
有活干
and have a job.

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.210
你到底想了解什么？
What do you really want to know?

02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:02.960
我后悔犯罪吗？
Am I sorry for what I did?

02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:04.550
你后悔吗？
Well, are you?

02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:09.300
我没有一天不后悔
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

02:07:10.670 --> 02:07:14.120
但并非因为关在这里 也不为讨好你们
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

02:07:17.610 --> 02:07:20.170
回首前尘往事
I look back on the way I was then...

02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:23.470
那个
a young...

02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:28.070
犯下重罪的小笨蛋
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

02:07:31.090 --> 02:07:32.780
我想跟他沟通
I want to talk to him.

02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:37.210
我试图讲道理
I want to try and talk some sense to him.

02:07:37.930 --> 02:07:39.860
让他明了
Tell him the way things are.

02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:43.400
但我办不到
But I can't.

02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:47.590
那个少年早就不见了
That kid's long gone...

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:51.570
只剩下我垂老之躯
and this old man is all that's left.

02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:54.470
我得接受事实
I got to live with that.

02:07:55.810 --> 02:07:57.510
改过自新？
Rehabilitated?

02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:59.710
狗屁不通的词儿
It's just a bullshit word.

02:08:00.650 --> 02:08:05.420
盖章吧  别浪费我的时间
So you go on and stamp your forms,sonny, and stop wasting my time.

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:08.920
告诉你一句实话
Because to tell you the truth...

02:08:09.260 --> 02:08:11.250
我他妈的不在乎
I don't give a shit.

02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:39.180
你的 小姐
Here you go, miss.

02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:43.140
可以上厕所吗？
Restroom break?

02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:53.490
别一尿尿就来报告  要去就去  懂吗?
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.

02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:56.120
是
Yes.

02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:09.600
我报告了40年
Forty years I've been asking permission to piss.

02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:13.440
不报告  一滴也挤不出
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:19.110
我得面对一个残酷的事实
There's a harsh truth to face.

02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:23.690
在狱外我根本混不下去
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.

02:10:31.570 --> 02:10:35.260
我一心想违犯假释
All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...

02:10:36.070 --> 02:10:38.560
也许就能重返肖申克
so maybe they'd send me back.

02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:46.180
活在恐惧中真是糟糕
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:48.740
老布体会过
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:50.890
他看透了
Knew it all too well.

02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:55.890
我只想回到有意义的地方
All I want is to be back where things make sense.

02:10:56.330 --> 02:10:59.060
不必整天担惊受怕
Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:03.430
只有一件事阻止了我
Only one thing stops me.

02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:07.270
我向安迪做过承诺
A promise I made to Andy.

02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:28.920
到了
There it is.

02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:41.200
非常感谢您
Much obliged, sir.

02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:21.780
“亲爱的瑞德：”
Dear Red:

02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:24.510
“见到这封信的时候，你已经出狱了。”
If you're reading this,you've gotten out...

02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:28.750
“既然走了这么远的路，干脆再走远一点吧。”
and if you've come this far,maybe you'd come a bit further.

02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:31.520
“你还记得那个地方的名字，是吗？”
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:35.290
“芝华塔尼欧。”
Zihuatanejo.

02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:40.530
“请来帮我实现计划，”
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.

02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:44.570
“我备妥棋盘等着你。”
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:46.780
“记住，瑞德，”
Remember, Red...

02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:49.210
“心怀希望是一件好事，”
hope is a good thing...

02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:51.410
“也许是最好的事。”
maybe the best of things.

02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:53.780
“心怀希望，就永远都有希望。”
And no good thing ever dies.

02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.190
“希望这封信，能让我再次见到你，”
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...

02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:59.120
“一个健在的你。”
and finds you well.

02:15:59.630 --> 02:16:00.860
“你的朋友”
Your friend...

02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:02.220
“安迪”
Andy.

02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:37.790
“要么忙着活，”
"Get busy living...

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.900
“要么忙着死。”
or get busy dying."

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:44.770
这话真他妈的精辟
That's goddamn right.

02:16:50.010 --> 02:16:52.140
这是生平第二次
For the second time in my life...

02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:54.940
我又犯了罪
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:57.950
违反假释出城
Parole violation.

02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:02.280
我怀疑警方会设路障抓我
Of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.

02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.980
不过我这种老贼大可免了
Not for an old crook like me.

02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:07.220
去德州汉考克堡  谢谢
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:15.630
我激动得不能安坐或思考
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.

02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:19.400
我想  只有真正的自由人
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.

02:17:19.610 --> 02:17:22.100
在踏上远征那一刻  才会生出这种
A free man at the start of a long journey...

02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:24.900
即将揭开未来神秘面纱的激动心情吧
whose conclusion is uncertain.

02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:30.580
我希望能顺利跨越边境
I hope I can make it across the border.

02:17:32.090 --> 02:17:35.110
我希望能跟重逢老友握握手
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:41.050
我希望太平洋如梦中一般蓝
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:44.090
我希望……
I hope.
